# About me

I am Bashiru Mukaila, an alumnus of both the University of Lagos and the University of Glasgow. Additionally, I am a student member of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.

With over 6 years of experience in the insurance industry, my focus has been on delivering actuarial services. Throughout my career, I've undertaken various projects and assumed diverse roles, including:
  1.	Reserving for life insurance businesses.
  2.	Analyzing changes and surpluses for life insurance businesses.
  3.	Valuing technical liabilities for non-life insurance businesses.
  4.	Spearheading the modeling of Own Risk Solvency Assessments for non-life insurance businesses, spanning areas such as auto, fire, marine, oil and gas, casualty, and employer liability.
  5.	Engaging in insurance pricing.
  6.	Contributing to financial reporting.

My proficiency extends to the use of spreadsheets, Excel VBA, SQL, R, and Prophet Professional. However, beyond technical expertise, my driving force lies in my passion for my work and my innate curiosity, which continuously propels me to enhance my skills and evolve as a professional.
